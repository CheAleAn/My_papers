Some code of my papers.
Will work if you have RastrWIN (special software to calculate staionary modes of power systems) or change/add some methods.
14_nodes - my first paper (Matlab). Finding parametres os system to reduce voltage and power losses in system. Algorithm based on genetic algorithm.
find-57-inf - my last paper (Python). Algorithm to choose number, places and capacity of installing batteries in the power system to make power system more effective with some additional conditions.
